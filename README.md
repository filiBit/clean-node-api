A web API that demonstrates some of the arguably best coding practices.

Inspired by **Clean code** paradigm and **SOLID principles**.

## Info

- The API is RESTful and written in Javascript (Node.js environment)

- The only production dependencies are Node's built-in modules

- **It's work in progress**

## Usage
1. Run the following command inside the project folder: `node index.js`
2. After the app is built and started, you should see a message about the server state

## Known Issues:
- In some environments, methods in Node's FileSystem module have case insensitive path arguments. That can cause data operations to be performed on invalid resources.

## Any questions?
